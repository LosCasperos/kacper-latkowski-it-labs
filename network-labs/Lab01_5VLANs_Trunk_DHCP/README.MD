# Lab 01 – VLANs + Trunking + DHCP + Router-on-a-Stick

## Description
This project demonstrates the design and configuration of a multi-VLAN network using trunking, inter-VLAN routing (Router-on-a-Stick), and dynamic IP address assignment via DHCP.

The lab includes:
- 5 VLANs (HR, IT, Sales, Guests, Mgmt)
- 3 access switches and 1 main switch
- Centralized Router-on-a-Stick with subinterfaces
- DHCP service running on the router for dynamic IP address allocation

## Files included
- `Lab01_5VLANs_Trunk_DHCP.pkt` — Packet Tracer topology file
- `Lab01_5VLANs_Trunk_DHCP_Documentation.odt` — Full project documentation (topology, configuration, tests, packet analysis, troubleshooting)
- `Lab01_5VLANs_Trunk_DHCP_Topology.png` - Topology file.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- VLAN creation and management
- Switch trunk port configuration
- Router subinterface configuration for inter-VLAN routing
- DHCP server configuration for multiple VLANs
- Packet-level analysis of DHCP DORA process
- Troubleshooting connectivity issues between VLANs
